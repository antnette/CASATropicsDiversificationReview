The American Tropics, more popularly referred to as the “Neotropics”, is the most biodiverse region in the world. For decades, scientists have introduced countless speciation hypotheses in an attempt to address how and why this region is so species rich. Despite these attempts, the origins and persistence of this biodiversity remain a mystery. In this review, we identify the main diversification modes at play and comprehensively revisit and explore these long-standing diversification hypotheses in the Central America and South American Tropics (CASA Tropics). Not only do we look at their origins and how they have progressed over the years, but we also offer additional perspective by compiling a large meta-analysis of over 2,000 publications, which we narrowed to almost 500 publications, to reveal underlying patterns in distribution and coverage across taxonomic groups, biogeographical regions, and drivers of diversification within the major hypotheses. In addition to revisiting our understanding of this biodiversity’s hotspots complex history, we also work towards an inclusive intention of changing the narrative surrounding the body of work that is done in this region and refer to the “Neotropics” as the CASA Tropics throughout this work to build on STEM’s efforts to work towards inclusive and non-colonizer language. Not only is it crucial to revisit our scientific understanding in this ultra-diverse region, but it is equally necessary for us to consider how we can shift the community’s language and research to be more inclusive.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

`{r cars} summary(cars)`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

`{r pressure, echo=FALSE} plot(pressure)`

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
